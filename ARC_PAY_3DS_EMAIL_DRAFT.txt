Hi ARC Team,

Thank you for your feedback regarding the missing 3DS authentication on our test transactions.

We have identified the issue and implemented the fix based on your documentation.

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
Our INITIATE_CHECKOUT request was missing the 3DS configuration parameter.

FIX APPLIED:
We have added the following to our request:

{
  "apiOperation": "INITIATE_CHECKOUT",
  "interaction": {
    "operation": "PURCHASE",
    "returnUrl": "https://www.jetsetterss.com/payment/callback?quote_id=xxx",
    "cancelUrl": "https://www.jetsetterss.com/inquiry/xxx?payment=cancelled",
    "merchant": {
      "name": "JetSet Travel"
    },
    "displayControl": {
      "billingAddress": "OPTIONAL",
      "customerEmail": "OPTIONAL"
    },
    "timeout": 900,
    "action": {
      "3DSecure": "MANDATORY"
    }
  },
  "order": {
    "id": "payment-uuid",
    "reference": "payment-uuid",
    "amount": "111.00",
    "currency": "USD",
    "description": "Quote Q-xxx - Travel Booking"
  },
  "customer": {
    "email": "customer@email.com"
  }
}

REFERENCE:
https://api.arcpay.travel/api/documentation/integrationGuidelines/hostedCheckout/features.html

Quote from documentation:
"Set interaction.action.3DSecure=MANDATORY, the Hosted PaymentPage uses 3DS authentication with the payer"

REQUEST:

1. Please confirm if our merchant account (TESTARC05511704) is configured for 3DS authentication.

2. If 3DS is not enabled on our merchant account, please enable it so the MANDATORY parameter will work.

3. We will run new test transactions and request your review.
