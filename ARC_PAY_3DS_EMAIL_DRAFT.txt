OUR QUESTIONS:

1. Is 3DS enabled on our merchant account (TESTARC05511704)?
   - If not, can you please enable it?

2. Do we need to configure 3-D Secure Rules in the Transaction Filtering settings?
   - If yes, please provide instructions or enable it on our behalf.

3. Are there any additional API parameters required in our INITIATE_CHECKOUT request to trigger 3DS?
   - We tried adding "authentication" block but received "Unexpected parameter" error.

4. Should 3DS be configured as:
   - "Always Authenticate" (mandatory for all transactions)?
   - "Attempt Authentication" (try 3DS, proceed if unavailable)?

---

WHAT WE NEED:

Please configure our merchant account so that:
- All transactions trigger 3DS authentication
- Both "Authentication" and "Payment" transactions appear in the portal
- Payer Authentication Status shows successful authentication (not "Not In Effect")
