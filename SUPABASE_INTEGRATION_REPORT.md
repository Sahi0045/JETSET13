# Supabase Integration Report

## 1. Overview

This report provides a summary of the Supabase integration in the SAHI travel app. It outlines where Supabase is used and which parts of the application do not have direct Supabase integration.

## 2. Supabase Configuration

- The Supabase client is configured in `backend/config/supabase.js`.
- It connects to the Supabase instance using the `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` environment variables.
- The `server.js` file includes a connection test to verify the Supabase connection on startup.

## 3. Supabase Usage

Supabase is primarily used for user authentication and data management. The main areas of integration are:

- **`backend/models/user.model.js`:** This file handles all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the `users` table.
- **`backend/migrations/add-google-auth.js`:** This migration script modifies the `users` table to support Google OAuth.

## 4. Areas Without Direct Supabase Integration

The following backend services do not have direct integration with Supabase:

- **Flight, Hotel, and Cruise Routes:** These services rely on the Amadeus API for data and do not interact with the Supabase client.
- **Payment Routes:** The payment processing logic is handled by a separate payment gateway and does not have direct Supabase integration.
- **Email Routes:** The email service uses the Resend API and does not connect to Supabase.

## 5. Conclusion

The Supabase integration is well-defined and focused on user management. The core travel and payment features are handled by specialized external APIs, which is a good architectural practice.
